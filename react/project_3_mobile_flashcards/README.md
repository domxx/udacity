# Mobile Flashcards

This app for iOS and Android allows users to create decks and quiz themselves.
It was built using create-react-native-app package (react native, expo...).

## How to start the app

1. install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```
2. start the app
```bash
yarn start
```
Now a QR code appeares in the terminal. Scan it with your Expo app with your smartphone and the Mobile Flashcards app will start.

This project was tested on both iOS (version 11) and Android (version 9).
